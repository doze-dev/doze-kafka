# Changelog

User-visible changes, newest first. A change to the exported surface of
`server/` (the embedding API, pinned in `testdata/api/server.txt`) needs a line
here that contains "server API"; `task api` fails without it.

## Unreleased

- server API: `Server.Traffic()` and `Server.ClientMetrics()` are removed. They
  returned types from `internal/` that a caller outside the module could not
  name; this module's own commands read them through `internal/serverhook`.
- server API: the exported surface is now pinned (`task api`).
