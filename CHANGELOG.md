# Changelog

User-visible changes, newest first. A change to the exported surface of
`server/` (the embedding API, pinned in `testdata/api/server.txt`) needs a line
here that contains "server API"; `task api` fails without it.

## Unreleased

- durability: a retry of an idempotent `acks=all` batch that the log already holds is
  now fsynced before it is acknowledged; it was acknowledged straight from the page
  cache (BAD-1).
- durability: after a failed `fsync` a partition refuses writes until the broker
  restarts, instead of retrying the sync and acknowledging data the kernel may have
  dropped. Kafka takes the log directory offline for the same reason (BAD-3).
- error codes: a full or failing disk is `KAFKA_STORAGE_ERROR` (retriable) from
  CreateTopics, CreatePartitions, IncrementalAlterConfigs, DeleteGroups and
  OffsetDelete as well as Produce, OffsetCommit and Fetch, where it was
  `UNKNOWN_SERVER_ERROR`; an `acks=0` produce that the disk could not take closes
  the connection, as Kafka does for any refused partition (BAD-4).
- JoinGroup: a `session.timeout.ms` below 6000 or above 1800000 is
  `INVALID_SESSION_TIMEOUT`, as in a stock Kafka broker; any value was accepted
  before (BAD-29).
- tests: the power-cut model keeps only what was fsynced and checks every `acks=all`
  record survives; `SIGKILL` could not see a missing fsync (BAD-13).
- console: Traffic shows the whole time, result and duration of every request (a long
  error name wraps instead of being cut), and every number on its summary line says its
  window: "313 requests and 3 errors in the last minute". At 390 px requests are cards
  and the keys strip is not drawn.
- console: the top bar names the broker by its instance name (the one it answers to
  as `kafka.<name>.doze`), not by the data directory's basename.
- console: the empty Topics page and the create form follow the design: what exists,
  what it is not, the `kafka-topics.sh` command that follows the form, the replication
  factor, what happens next, and a name that is taken is said so while it is typed.
  Field help is a sentence, no longer `unit: ms; range: -1 or more; applied`.
- console: a group's Lag tab ends in Try it (set one partition's offset), and its
  neighbours name its members and the subject of what it reads.
- console: ACL type, operation and permission are written as Topic, Write and ALLOW;
  the Topics table says "no group has committed" instead of "nobody", and "written by"
  says it comes from the recent requests and how old they are.
- console: the command palette has Topics, Groups, Subjects and Actions and no "Go to"
  group; the sections are the rail's and the `g` chords'.
- console: the templates are parsed on the first console request, not at start, so a
  broker nobody opens the console on holds about 1 MB less (idle heap 2.70 MB to 1.71 MB).

- server API: `Server.Traffic()` and `Server.ClientMetrics()` are removed. They
  returned types from `internal/` that a caller outside the module could not
  name; this module's own commands read them through `internal/serverhook`.
- server API: the exported surface is now pinned (`task api`).
